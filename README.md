# guessing_game
A guessing game.
Hereâ€™s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100.

It will then prompt the player to enter a guess.

After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high.

If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.
